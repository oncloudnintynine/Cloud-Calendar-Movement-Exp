# ☁️ Cloud Moves - Setup & Developer Guide

Cloud Moves is a serverless, Progressive Web App (PWA) built to manage company personnel, leave/event records, and Key Appointment Holder (KAH) constraints. It utilizes a static front-end hosted on GitHub Pages, communicating with a backend powered entirely by Google Apps Script (GAS) and Google Workspace APIs (Drive, Sheets, Contacts, Calendar, Gmail).

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
*   **Frontend**: HTML5, TailwindCSS (CDN), Vanilla JavaScript. Hosted statically (e.g., via GitHub Pages).
*   **Backend**: Google Apps Script (GAS). Acts as a serverless REST API processing GET/POST requests.
*   **Database**: Google Sheets (Leave/Event records), Google Contacts (User Directory & Organizational Structure), Google Calendar (Event Visualizations).
*   **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions using Google Clasp to auto-deploy backend changes.

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Backend Setup (Google Apps Script)

1. **Create the Script Project:**
   * Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com/) and create a **New Project**.
   * Name it `Cloud Moves Backend`.
2. **Enable Google Workspace Services:**
   * On the left sidebar, click on **Services** (the `+` icon).
   * Find and add the **People API**. 
3. **Import Backend Code:**
   * Create files matching the exact names in the `backend/` folder of the repository (`Code.gs`, `Auth.gs`, `Calendar.gs`, `Leaves.gs`, `Settings.gs`, `Github.gs`).
   * *Note: GAS uses the `.gs` extension instead of `.js`.* Copy and paste the respective contents into each file.
   * Open the project settings (gear icon) and check **"Show 'appsscript.json' manifest file in editor"**. Overwrite the `appsscript.json` with the one from the repo.
4. **Initialize the Database:**
   * Open `Code.gs`.
   * Select the `INITIAL_SETUP` function from the dropdown in the top toolbar and click **Run**.
   * Google will prompt you to authorize the script. Click **Review Permissions**, choose your Google Account, click **Advanced**, and proceed to the script.
   * *This function will automatically create a new Google Sheet named `Company_Leaves_DB` in your Google Drive and set up all default configuration properties.*
5. **Deploy the Web App:**
   * Click the **Deploy** button (top right) -> **New deployment**.
   * Click the gear icon next to "Select type" and choose **Web app**.
   * **Description**: `Initial Deployment`
   * **Execute as**: `Me` *(Crucial: This ensures the app uses your account's Drive/Contacts)*.
   * **Who has access**: `Anyone` *(Crucial: Allows the frontend to communicate with it anonymously; the app handles its own auth)*.
   * Click **Deploy**.
   * **Copy the Web App URL** and the **Deployment ID**. Save these for later.

## 🖥️ Step 2: Frontend Setup

1. **Configure the API Endpoint:**
   * Open `frontend/js/core/config.js` in your code editor.
   * Replace the `PROD_URL` (and/or `DEV_URL`) with the **Web App URL** you copied in Step 1.
2. **Deploy the Frontend:**
   * Push your code to your GitHub repository.
   * Go to your repository settings -> **Pages**.
   * Set the source to deploy from the `main` branch (root directory).
   * Your app will now be accessible at `https://[your-username].github.io/[repo-name]/frontend/`.

## 🤖 Step 3: CI/CD Setup (Automated Backend Deployment)

To allow GitHub to push updates directly to Google Apps Script, you must configure `clasp` (Google's CLI tool) and add secrets to your repository.

1. **Install and Authenticate Clasp Locally:**
   * Make sure you have Node.js installed. Run: `npm install -g @google/clasp`
   * Run: `clasp login`
   * Log in with the Google Account hosting the Apps Script. This generates a `~/.clasprc.json` file on your computer.
2. **Retrieve Project IDs:**
   * **Script ID**: Found in GAS Project Settings (gear icon) under "IDs".
   * **Deployment ID**: Found via GAS Deploy -> Manage deployments.
3. **Configure GitHub Secrets:**
   * Go to your GitHub Repository -> **Settings** -> **Secrets and variables** -> **Actions**.
   * Add the following Repository Secrets:
     * `CLASP_CREDS`: Paste the *entire* contents of your local `~/.clasprc.json` file.
     * `SCRIPT_ID`: Paste your Script ID.
     * `DEPLOYMENT_ID`: Paste your Deployment ID.
4. **How it works:**
   Every time you push a change to the `backend/` folder on the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will trigger `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, pushing the code and updating the exact same Web App URL so your frontend never breaks.

## ⚙️ Step 4: Initial App Configuration

1. **First Login:**
   * Open your frontend URL.
   * The default administrator password is `P@ssw0rd`.
   * Log in to access the App.
2. **Configure Admin Settings:**
   * Go to **Menu -> Admin Settings**.
   * **Admin Password**: Change it immediately.
   * **User Login Keyword**: Set the keyword users append to their phone number to log in (e.g., `peace`).
   * **Organisational Structure**: Build your unit hierarchy. 
   * **Register Users**: Register your first batch of users. Google Contacts syncing takes ~1 minute to reflect.

## 🛠️ Long-Term Maintenance & Enhancement Guide

### 1. Modifying the Frontend (UI/UX)
* The frontend relies heavily on **TailwindCSS**. You can modify the UI by adding Tailwind classes directly into the HTML strings found in `js/ui/ui.js` and `js/features/*.js`.
* **Cache Busting**: Because the app is a PWA, browsers cache the Javascript files. When you push an update to the frontend, go to `frontend/index.html` and increment the version numbers at the bottom of the file (e.g., change `?v=55` to `?v=56`). Update `sw.js` `CACHE_NAME` similarly.

### 2. Modifying the Backend (Google Apps Script)
* **Testing Locally**: You cannot run GAS backend locally. To test backend changes safely, create a separate "Test" deployment in Apps Script, copy that URL, and put it in `DEV_URL` inside `config.js`. Toggle `ENV = 'Dev'` to test without affecting production.
* **Database Schema Changes**: If you add new data fields to `Leaves.js`, ensure you update the `verifySchema` array in `Code.js` to automatically generate the new columns in the Google Sheet.

### 3. Fail-Safe Code Updater & Backups
* In **Admin Settings -> Code Backup**, you can trigger a 1-click backup of the latest GitHub repository code to a Google Doc in your Drive.
* If the automated CI/CD pipeline ever fails (e.g., expired Clasp credentials), you can utilize the backup Doc text with the [Fail-Safe Code Updater](https://oncloudnintynine.github.io/Fail-Safe-Code-Updater/) tool linked in the admin menu to manually patch the backend.

### 4. Handling Google Contact Sync Issues
Google Contacts is used as the directory. If a user is not appearing correctly:
1. Ensure the user's phone number exists exactly as registered.
2. If units are renamed or corrupted in Google Contacts, use the **"Force Sync G-Contacts"** button located in the **Organisational Structure** admin tab to wipe the relevant Contact data and overwrite it completely with the App's state.
